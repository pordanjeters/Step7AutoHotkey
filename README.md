# Step7AutoHotkey
Hotstrings and hotkeys for Siemens Step 7 (v5.7)

Based on TheFern2's hotkeys for Step 7

I loathe the GUI editor for Step 7 and the lack of shortcut keys. If you do too, and like me you come from the world of AB/Rockwell Automation, maybe this could be of use. 
Since there are data type-specific math and comparison instructions, mnemonics comes in one of a few flavors i.e. type "geqi" for INT >= comparison instruction, "geqd" for DINT ?= comparison instruction,etc.
Fairly limited at the moment but will continue to grow it as I find new operations I'd like to optimize.
I have only tested these out using the LAD view of the LAD/STL/FBD editor, as that's the only one I really want to use.
